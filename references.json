    "abstract": "Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while\nobeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and\nsocial science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular\ngraph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired\nproperties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying\nphysical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find\nmolecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex\nand non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose\nGraph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional\nnetwork based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement\nlearning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and\nadversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that\nincorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can\nachieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art\nbaselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the\nconstrained property optimization task.",

We develop a systematic framework called BEELINE for this purpose. We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative GRN inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining GRN inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of GRN inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing ligands that bind their target biomolecules with high affinity and specificity is a key step in small- molecule drug discovery, but accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies remains challenging. Key sources of errors in the calculations include inadequate sampling of conformational space, ambiguous protonation states, and errors in force fields. Noncovalent complexes between a host molecule with a binding cavity and a drug-like guest molecules have emerged as powerful model systems. As model systems, host-guest complexes reduce many of the errors in more complex protein-ligand binding systems, as their small size greatly facilitates conformational sampling, and one can choose systems that avoid ambiguities in protonation states. These features, combined with their ease of experimental characterization, make host-guest systems ideal model systems to test and ultimately optimize force fields in the context of binding thermodynamics calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Force Field Initiative aims to create a modern, open software infrastructure for automatically generating and assessing force fields using data sets. The first force field to arise out of this effort, named SMIRNOFF99Frosst, has approximately one tenth the number of parameters, in version 1.0.5, compared to typical general small molecule force fields, such as GAFF. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of this initial force field, using free energy calculations of 43 α and β-cyclodextrin host-guest pairs for which experimental thermodynamic data are available, and compare with matched calculations using two versions of GAFF. For all three force fields, we used TIP3P water and AM1-BCC charges. The calculations are performed using the attach-pull-release (APR) method as implemented in the open source package, pAPRika. For binding free energies, the root mean square error of the SMIRNOFF99Frosst calculations relative to experiment is 0.9 [0.7, 1.1] kcal/mol, while the corresponding results for GAFF 1.7 and GAFF 2.1 are 0.9 [0.7, 1.1] kcal/mol and 1.7 [1.5, 1.9] kcal/mol, respectively, with 95% confidence ranges in brackets. These results suggest that SMIRNOFF99Frosst performs competitively with existing small molecule force fields and is a parsimonious starting point for optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways are a cornerstone of systems biology. Several databases store high-quality representations of these pathways that are amenable for automated analyses. Despite painstaking and manual curation, these databases remain incomplete. We present PATHLINKER, a new computational method to reconstruct the interactions in a signaling pathway of interest. PATHLINKER efficiently computes multiple short paths from the receptors to transcriptional regulators (TRs) in a pathway within a background protein interaction network. We use PATHLINKER to accurately reconstruct a comprehensive set of signaling pathways from the NetPath and KEGG databases. We show that PATHLINKER has higher precision and recall than several state-of-the-art algorithms, while also ensuring that the resulting network connects receptor proteins to TRs. PATHLINKER's reconstruction of the Wnt pathway identified CFTR, an ABC class chloride ion channel transporter, as a novel intermediary that facilitates the signaling of Ryk to Dab2, which are known components of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In HEK293 cells, we show that the Ryk-CFTR-Dab2 path is a novel amplifier of β-catenin signaling specifically in response to Wnt 1, 2, 3, and 3a of the 11 Wnts tested. PATHLINKER captures the structure of signaling pathways as represented in pathway databases better than existing methods. PATHLINKER's success in reconstructing pathways from NetPath and KEGG databases point to its applicability for complementing manual curation of these databases. PATHLINKER may serve as a promising approach for prioritizing proteins and interactions for experimental study, as illustrated by its discovery of a novel pathway in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our supplementary website at http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali/supplements/2016-sys-bio-applications-pathlinker/ provides links to the PATHLINKER software, input datasets, PATHLINKER reconstructions of NetPath pathways, and links to interactive visualizations of these reconstructions on GraphSpace.",
