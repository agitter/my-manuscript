### ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism
- ACE2 expression
Colonic enterocytes primarily express ACE2. Cellular pathways associated with ACE2 expression include innate immune signaling, HLA up regulation, energy metabolism and apoptotic signaling.  
This is a study of colonic biopsies taken from 17 children with and without IBD and analyzed using scRNAseq to look at ACE2 expression and identify gene families correlated with ACE2 expression. The authors find ACE2 expression to be primarily in colonocytes.  It is not clear why both healthy and IBD patients were combined for the analysis. Biopsies were all of children so extrapolation to adults is limited. The majority of genes found to be negatively correlated with ACE2 expression include immunoglobulin genes (IGs). IG expression will almost certainly be low in colonocytes irrespective of ACE2 expression.  
This study performs a retrospective analysis of ACE2 expression using an RNAseq dataset from intestinal biopsies of children with and without IBD. The implications for the CoV-19 epidemic are modest, but do provide support that ACE2 expression is specific to colonocytes in the intestines.  The ontological pathway analysis provides some limited insights into gene expression associated with ACE2.

### The inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide blocks coronavirus RNA replication by targeting viral NSP15
This study reconsiders the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the
treatment of pneumonia by coronavirus. Corticosteroids were associated
with increased mortality for SARS in 2003 and for MERS in 2013, probably
due to that fact that systemic corticosteroids suppress the innate
immune system, resulting in increased viral replication. However, some
steroid compounds might block coronavirus replication. The authors
screened steroids from a chemical library and assessed the viral growth
suppression and drug cytotoxicity. Ciclesonide demonstrated low
cytotoxicity and potent suppression of MERS-CoV viral growth. The
commonly used systemic steroids cortisone, prednisolone and
dexamethasone did not suppress viral growth, nor did the commonly used
replication, the authors conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoV passages in
the presence of ciclesonide or mometasone, and they could generate a
mutant virus that developed resistance to ciclesonide, but not to
(NSP15) as the predicted mechanism for viral resistance to ciclesonide.
The authors were able to successfully generate a recombinant virus
antiviral target of mometasone is different from that of ciclesonide.
Lastly, the effects of ciclesonide and mometason on suppressing the
replication of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Both compounds were found to
suppress viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir.
NSP15 were conducted with MERS-CoV. This is not the closest related
virus to SARS-CoV-2, as that would be SARS-CoV. Thus, to repeat the
initial experiments with SARS-CoV, or preferably SARS-CoV-2, is
essential. The manuscript should address this and, therefore, it will
require considerable editing for organization and clarity. Also, in
contains several predicted B and T cell immunogenic epitopes that are
shared with other coronaviruses, some studies have shown critical
differences between MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. A main criticism
is that the authors only used VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells to gauge the direct
cytotoxic effects of viral replication. To evaluate this in other cell
infectivity of coronavirus strains greatly varies in different cell
that have been shown to increase viral replication in vitro. This should
be evaluated in future clinical studies.

undetectable level by day 15 post infection. It may suggest that there
is a faster viral clearance mechanism in monkeys, therefore the
conclusions of reinfection protection for humans need to be carefully
considered. In addition, only two monkeys were re-infected in this study
and the clinical signs of these monkeys were not similar: M3 did not
show weight loss and M4 showed relatively higher fever on the day of
infection and the day of re-challenge.
This study showed clear viral clearance and no indications of relapse or
viremia after a secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a Chinese rhesus
macaque model. These results support the idea that patients with full
recovery (two negative RT-PCR results) may also be protected from
secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recovered patients may be able to
reintegrate to normal public life and provide protective serum perhaps
even if having had a mild infection. The results are also encouraging

### SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients
- cross-reactivity
Antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the S1 subunit and the RBD (receptor-binding domain) were detected in all SARS-CoV-2 patient sera by 13 to 21 days post onset of disease.  Antibodies specific to SARS-CoV N protein (90% similarity to SARS-CoV-2) were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT (plaque reduction neutralizing test).  SARS-CoV-2 serum cross-reacted with SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins, and to a lower extent with MERS-CoV S protein, but not with the MERS-CoV S1 protein, consistent with an analysis of genetic similarity.  No reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was observed in serum from patients with ubiquitous human CoV infections (common cold) or to non-CoV viral respiratory infections.  
Authors describe development of a serological ELISA based assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies towards regions of the spike and nucleocapsid domains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Serum samples were obtained from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients.  Negative control samples include a cohort of patients with confirmed recent exposure to non-CoV infections (i.e. adenovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, influenza, RSV, CMV, EBV) as well as a cohort of patients with confirmed infections with ubiquitous human CoV infections known to cause the common cold. The study also included serum from patients with previous MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV zoonotic infections. This impressive patient cohort allowed the authors to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the development of their in-house ELISA assay. Of note, seroconversion was observed as early as 13 days following COVID-19 onset but the authors were not clear how disease onset was determined.  
Validated serological tests are urgently needed to map the full spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population and to determine the kinetics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.  Furthermore, clinical trials are ongoing using plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 as a therapeutic option.  An assay such as the one described in this study could be used to screen for strong antibody responses in recovered patients.  Furthermore, the assay could be used to screen health care workers for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as personal protective equipment continues to dwindle.  The challenge going forward will be to standardize and scale-up the various in-house ELISA’s being developed in independent laboratories across the world.

### ACE-2 Expression in the Small Airway Epithelia of Smokers and COPD Patients: Implications for COVID-19
In bronchial epithelial samples from 3 different cohorts of
individuals, ACE-2 gene expression was found to be significantly
increased in both COPD patients and smokers relative to healthy
controls. Across all test subjects, ACE-2 gene expression was also
highly correlated with decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1), which may explain the increased COVID-19 disease severity in
COPD patients. Former smokers were also found to show decreased ACE2
expression relative to current smokers and had no significant difference
when compared to non-smokers.
While the upregulation of ACE-2 is an interesting
leaves many more unanswered questions than it addresses. Further studies
are required to show whether the specific cell type isolated in these
studies is relevant to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Furthermore,
there is no attempt to show whether that increased ACE-2 expression
contributes to greater disease severity. Does the increased ACE-2
expression lead to greater infectivity with SARS-CoV-2? There is no
mechanistic explanation for why ACE-2 levels are increased in COPD
patients. The authors could also have considered the impact of
bronchodilators on ACE-2 expression. Finally, given the extensive
more in-depth analyses into gene signature differences.
This study attempts to address an
increased mortality from COVID-19. The novel finding that ACE-2
expression is induced in smokers and COPD patients suggests not only a

Also, studying different subset of lymphocytes could lead to a more

precise study showed that the percentage of helper T cells and
regulatory T cells decrease but the percentage of naïve helper T cells
increases in severe cases [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa248]. Taking these subpopulations into account
might make the predictor more powerful.
Other studies also noted an inverse correlation between disease severity
